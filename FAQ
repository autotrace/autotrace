Some collectoins of "Question and Answers" posted to autotrace mailing
list. Some of these are not "Frequently" but are worth to be known(TIPS).

Q1. Using Windows you type autotrace -help you only see the last 25
lines, so how could we check that the user can read the whole help
text? (Martin Weber <martweb@gmx.net>)

A1. For NT-based Windows systems (WinNT, Win2000, XP), it's possible
to activate scrolling for the console window (DOS prompt). Just do a
right click on the title bar of the window, -> preferences -> layout,
and increase the buffer size.  This don't work for Win9x. I don't know
if it works for WinME. (Manfred Schwarb <manfred.schwarb@gmx.ch>)

Q2. Why configure checks pstoedit twice?
    
    First you are checking
    checking for PSTOEDIT - version >= 3.32.1... no
    and then
    checking for PSTOEDIT - version >= 3.32.0... yes

    why not
    checking for PSTOEDIT - version == 3.32.0... yes
    instead?

    (Martin Weber <martweb@gmx.net>)
A2. We have to detect one of the three states:

    1. We don't have pstoedit or have pstoedit older than 3.32.
       -- We should not build pstoedit output functions.
    2. We have pstoedit 3.32.
       -- pstoedit-config in 3.32 has some bugs. workaround macros
	  must be enabled.
    3. We have pstoedit 3.33. or higher
       -- The workaround macros must be diasbled. I sent patches 
	  that fixes the bugs to the author of pstoedit. So the 
	  pstoedit-config in 3.33 will not have the bugs.

So, configure checks pstoedit twice.

autotrace.m4 has only '>=' version checking. It doesn't have == or >
version checking. (In other hand, PKG_CHECK_MODULES has such version
checking.) I don't want to extend autotrace.m4 anymore.  It will cause
bugs. (Masatake YAMATO<yamato@redhat.com>)
