Core: 
- Speed up
- Improve tracing quality
- Bugs?!
- Recognition of Circle and Ellipse pieces.
- Addition of code to recognize lines, splines and circles even if there is
  a lot of noise
- Currently pictures have to fit completely into memory
- New algorithm to work best with anti-aliased pictures
- 3D recognition
- Better list management, that means the current generation of lists is time
  consuming and fragmentates the heap.
- Outlines are traced two times that means that it could be faster and if we
  trace and fit every outline only once we will not have the problems with
  unwanted gaps anymore.
- Better thinning algorithm like CAT (Chordal Axis Transformation)

Image preprocessing
- Framework
- Using gimp as preprocessor(contact with Masatake YAMATO<yamato@redhat.com>)

Input:
- Migrate to new plug-in interface using glib(0.32.0)
- Support of image libraries as freeimage, gdk-pixbuf or paintlib(0.32.0)

Output:
- Migrate to new plug-in interface using glib(0.32.0)
- Output API abstraction(0.33.0)
- New export formats like wmf, cdr, cmx, compressed pdf, compressed svg and
  dxf with splines...

Library and its clients:
- Graphical user interface
  -- using gnome/gtk+, frontline is under developing.
     See http://autotrace.sourceforge.net/frontline
  -- using KDE/Qt (working)
  -- using Windows native (working)

Misc:
- Gettextize(0.32.0, done)
- Better documentations(working)
- Predefined parameter system(discussed as aop file, 0.32.0)
- Better progress reporter, integrating to Image preprocessor
- using GError
